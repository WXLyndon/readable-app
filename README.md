# Readable
> Readable project is a reddit style discussion web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This project was built with React, Redux and Semantic UI. The application state (create, read, update, delete, vote, sort posts/comments) is controlled by Redux store. There is no user authentication in this app. Users can be able to edit/delete any posts/comments.
